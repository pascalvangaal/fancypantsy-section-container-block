# FancyPantsy Section Container Block
This all started out as a hobby of mine and the desire to try out making a _native_ Gutenberg block for the WordPress editor. So I thought to myself: "I might as well give something back to the community". So this repo is free to use for anybody who sees any use for it.

## Features
- Custom background for your section
-- Background image with position options.
-- Background color.
-- Option to position the background div to multiple locations.
- Section title
-- Heading type option
-- Position option
- A container block which **contains up to 4 columns**.
-- Here you are able to select either 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns which you can use to your hearts content.


## Upcomming features
Below you fill find a list of upcoming features concerning the section or columns. These are in no particulair order. Unless I would receive requests for a certain feature. 

### Section
- Settingspage with the ability to **only pick** the features you need.
- I18N for the entire plugin.
-- Dutch
-- English
-- T.B.D.
- Button option for the whole section.
-- Position option left - center - right
-- Label

-- Target

### Column
-- More column layout Options. Instead of only the ability to either use 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns in equal width, the ability to choose some more dynamic presets.
