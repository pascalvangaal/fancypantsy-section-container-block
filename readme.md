# FancyPantsy Section Container Block
This all started out as a hobby of mine and the desire to try and make a _native_ Gutenberg block for the WordPress editor. So I thought to myself: "I might as well give something back to the community". So this repo is free to use for anybody who sees any use for it.

## Features
- Custom background for your section
- - Background image with position options.
- - Background color.
- - Option to position the background div to multiple locations.
- Section title
- - Heading type option

- A container block which **contains up to 4 columns**.
- - Here you are able to select either 1, 2, 3 or 4 columns which you can use to your hearts content.
- A anchor for your section to link to.
- Inline margin/padding styling options.
